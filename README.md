# The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection

### A Spaciotemporal View of Art

#### Imagine having access to a world-class collection of art and antiquities at your fingertips, available for your viewing pleasure at any time?  Most of us will never have the means to own museum quality fine art, but The Metropolitan Museum of Art is providing high-resolution scans and documentation of its collection free of charge, to view on-line from the comfort of our own homes.  The Museum’s collection, available as an electronic dataset is currently approaching half a million records, almost a quarter of its over two million total works.  Each object in the dataset has a variety of location information available about the artist and the art.  With this information we can see the geographic origination of the Museums asseccions, and changes to the location of origination over time. 

#### Producing a map from the documentation made available by the Museum, using the biography and nationality of the artists, and the world-wide locations of the artworks’ origination, will allow the geographic information to be cohesively visualized.  Geovisualization of the data on the art and/or artist over space and time may provide interesting insights by comparing the type and style of artwork being produced around the world during the same period.  Currently, there is no straightforward process available with which this can be conceptualized.    The Museum’s collection stretches across 5,000 years, from antiquity to the present, and the high-resolution scans, along with geographic information such as city, state, country, region, subregion, locale, and river, will produce a compelling visualization as well as potential analysis possibilities. 

#### The wide-ranging appeal to audiences with little through extensive knowledge of art or geography, through the intersection of these two distinct knowledge spaces is exciting.  The map will enable viewing the origination of each object in the collection’s dataset.  It will also provide the possibility for a cartographic visualization of a variety of relationships between art, artist, and geography as it develops over through time.  The inclusion of the high-resolution scanned images of the original artwork, some of which are in the public domain, will inspire a diverse audience, from casual browsers to professionals to view images of some of the most important historical and artistic works of humanity.  This access will also allow a wide variety of users to creatively incorporate the public domain artworks for their own purposes.  While The Metropolitan Museum of Art is physically located in New York City, the electronic information made available by the museum, used through this map interface, will enable people from around the world to experience fine art, and use the public domain artwork in their own creative endeavors.

#### The data for this map is being made available by <a href=https://github.com/metmuseum>The Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access GitHub page</a>, and <a href=https://metmuseum.github.io/>The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API</a>.  The data available from GitHub is provided as a .csv file, using git-lfs (large file storage).  I have downloaded the .csv data from GitHub, and I have also forked the repo.  As of March, there are almost half a million records.  Data is being added often, but on an irregular basis, so data extract and wrangling is still at an early stage and will require a strategy for keeping the map in sync with the official dataset.  I have been using spreadsheet applications, git-lfs, Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, geopandas, psycopg, Carto, QGIS, and the API, and I anticipate possibly using PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin.  The anticipated format when ready for web map might be GeoJSON, CSV flat files, or a remote-hosted PostGres database.  The additional information I will want to generate for the final map includes all the supplemental information contained in the dataset about the artist and the artwork.  An example of the data follows:

#### The map will be a web browser-based application accessible across mobile and desktop devices.  The anticipated technology stack and JavaScript libraries will be HTML/SVG/CSS/JS, <a href=https://leafletjs.com>Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps</a>, and <a href=https://d3js.org/>D3.js, a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data</a>, with <a href=https://labs.mapbox.com/assembly>Assembly.css</a>, and potentially Turf.js, or simple-statistics.js.  The web page will be designed to work cross-platform, potentially optimized for mobile devices.  As more and more people access the internet only through their phones, simplicity will be key factor in creating a responsive design for mobile users. 

#### The artwork locations will be visually represented according to the type and specificity of the location information provided in the dataset.  Very specific locations will be represented as points or clustered points depending upon the density of the objects.  Objects with less specificity might need to be represented within polygons of countries or regions depending on the period of creation.  Artist nationality or location at the time of object creation would follow the same standards based on the availability of information.  Proportional icons would be used by type of artwork and proportion of artwork per location, if necessary, a choropleth representation for countries/regions might indicate the density of art created in that polygon.

#### Users will engage and interact with the map in a variety of ways.   Clicking on icons or countries will allow users to view the artwork in a pop-up or new browser window.  Pan and zoom capabilities will be available as well.  A scrolling interface will probably be employed.  In addition, some analysis using data science libraries and widgets in Python/Jupyter Notebook may be instructive in exploring the data when the geographic information is sparse or not available.  A dark motif will be employed, in conjunction with a minimalist aesthetic.  I am considering hewing to the design aesthetic of The Met website in order to foster a more cohesive design approach between the data source and map.  A more formal style and choice of typeface will be in keeping with the style of the art and objects in The Met collection.

#### The Metropolitan Museum of Art recorded over 7 million visitors in 2017, but most of the world will never enjoy the experience of the collection in person.  Additionally, the museum’s designation of many works of art as public domain, allows the high-resolutions scans to be accessed and used without restriction, by everyone.  The use of interactive cartography in conjunction with the museums data and high-resolution scans of the artwork, will allow anyone with a computer and internet connection to experience the artwork in conjunction with a new and interesting geo-visualization.
